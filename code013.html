                      constantly changing due to processes such as erosion,
                      weathering, plate tectonics, volcanism, and earthquakes.

                      Football is a family of team sports that involve, to
                      varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
                      Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of
                      football that is the most popular where the word is used.
                      Sports commonly called football include association
                      football (known as soccer in North America, Ireland,
                      Australia and South Africa); gridiron football
                      (specifically American football or Canadian football);
                      Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league;
                      and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football
                      share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as
                      "football codes".

                      Wallpaper is a material used in interior decoration to
                      cover the interior walls of domestic and public buildings.
                      It is usually sold in rolls and is applied onto a wall
                      using wallpaper paste. Wallpapers can come plain as
                      "lining paper" (so that it can be painted or used to help
                      cover uneven surfaces and minor wall defects thus giving a
                      better surface), textured (such as Anaglypta), with a
                      regular repeating pattern design, or, much less commonly
                      today, with a single non-repeating large design carried
                      over a set of sheets. The smallest rectangle that can be
                      tiled to form the whole pattern is known as the pattern
                      repeat.
